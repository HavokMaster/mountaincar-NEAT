# mountaincar-NEAT

This program leverages the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to evolve a neural network capable of solving the mountain car problem that aims to make an AI agent able to reach the top of a mountain.

# How to run

* (Optional) Tune the population and fitness criterion in the config file as per your requirements.
* Run the `evolve.py` to evolve the neural network and get the output as `winner-feedforward`.
* Run the `main.py` to load the trained network and run the simulation.
